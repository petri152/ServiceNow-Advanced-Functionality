# Stylesheet
So in order to use this stylesheet you must install an Add-On/Extension called "Stylus." 
It can be obtained from here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo?hl=en

1. Create a new style in Stylus.
2. From the left-hand side choose "Import" under "Mozilla Format"
3. Paste the contents of the CSS file into the window that opens.
4. Name it.
5. Save it.

That's it.
